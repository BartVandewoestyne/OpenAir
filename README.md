# OpenAir
OpenAir is a file format for describing airspaces.  It is defined online at http://www.winpilot.com/usersguide/userairspace.asp and is used by many devices used by sailplane, paragliding,... pilots.  The goal of this repository is to become a central place where people can download and contribute OpenAir files to be used in their software or device.

We are looking for volunteers to contribute to this project.  Feel free to contact us if you want to help maintain this repository.
